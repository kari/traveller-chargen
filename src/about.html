    <p>This is a <a href="index.html">character</a> and <a href="worldgen.html">world</a> generator for <a
        href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/355200/classic-traveller-facsimile-edition">the 1981 edition
        of the classic Traveller role-playing game</a> as defined in the Book 1 and Book 3 (and Book 2
      if the character is lucky enough to earn a starship). Some additional details are taken from Supplements 1
      (1001 Characters) and 12 (Forms and Charts) and The Traveller Book.</p>
    <p>By necessity, the generators are opionated because the generation process includes decision points,
      especially the character generation. While the decisions made by the generators are not necessarily the most
      optimized choices, they should anyway be quite reasonable.</p>
    <p>The generators are open sourced and the source code is available on <a
        href="https://github.com/kari/traveller-chargen">GitHub</a>.</p>
