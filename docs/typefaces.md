# Fonts used in Traveller books

## Cover font

The cover font used in the classic Traveller books is Optima Medium (Faux) Italic.[^1] [^2]. Optima is a provided system font on MacOS, but this is of little help for a web-based project. Fortunately, there are multiple alternatives for this font as listed on Wikipedia[^3], some of them are free. Some quite similar fonts like Arsenal, Marcellus and Belleza[^4] are available on Google Fonts.

This project uses the metrics-compatible[^5] URW Classico from Ghostscript[^6] project.

## Body text and headers

Body text in the Little Black Books is Univers 55 and headings use Univers 75[^7]. There are again multiple very similar alternatives available; Wikipedia lists Akzidenz-Grotesk, Folio, and Helvetica[^8]. However, Univers is likewise a PostScript core font so this project uses the free alternative[^9], URW Classic Sans, again from the Ghostscript project.

Google Fonts alternatives would include such sans-serif fonts as Open Sans and Roboto.
